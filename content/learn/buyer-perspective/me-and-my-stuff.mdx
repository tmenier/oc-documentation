Up until now, we have been working in the seller perspective. We bootstrapped a new organization and populated our first product catalog. Now that the administrative work is complete, we can change to the perspective of the buyer user we created in ["Establishing API Access"](/learn/getting-started/establishing-api-access).

To do so, you will need to retrieve an access token for your buyer user:

<CodeExample
  title="Password Grant-Type Workflow"
  description="Use the access token in the response for the remainder of this chapter."
  content={{
    http: `POST https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/oauth/token HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;\n
{
    client_id: "INSERT_SHARED_API_CLIENT_ID",
    grant_type: "password",
    username: "buyer01",
    password: "INSERT_BUYER_USER_PASSWORD",
    scope: "MeAdmin PasswordReset Shopper",
}`,
javascript: `import { Auth, Tokens, Configuration } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Configuration.Set({
  baseApiUrl: "https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io",
});
var username = "buyer01";
var password = "INSERT_BUYER_USER_PASSWORD";
var clientID = "INSERT_SHARED_API_CLIENT_ID";
var scope = [
    "MeAdmin",
    "PasswordReset",
    "Shopper"
];\n
Auth.Login(username, password, clientID, scope)
  .then(response => {
      // store token, now any subsequent calls will
      // automatically set this token in the headers for you
      var token = response.access_token;
      Tokens.setAccessToken(token)
  })
  .catch(err => console.log(err));`,
typescript: `import {
  ApiRole,
  AccessToken,
  OrderCloudError,
  Auth,
  Tokens,
  Configuration
} from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Configuration.Set({
  baseApiUrl: "https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io",
});
var username: string = "buyer01";
var password: string = "INSERT_BUYER_USER_PASSWORD";
var clientID: string = "INSERT_SHARED_API_CLIENT_ID";
var scope: ApiRole[] = [
  "MeAdmin",
  "PasswordReset",
  "Shopper"
];\n
Auth.Login(username, password, clientID, scope)
  .then((response: AccessToken) => {
    // store token, now any subsequent calls will
    // automatically set this token in the headers for you
    var token = response.access_token;
    Tokens.SetAccessToken(token)
  })
  .catch((err: OrderCloudError) => console.log(err));
  `,
csharp: `using OrderCloud.SDK;\n
var client = new OrderCloudClient(new OrderCloudClientConfig {
    ClientId = "INSERT_SHARED_API_CLIENT_ID",
    Username = "buyer01",
    Password = "INSERT_BUYER_USER_PASSWORD",
    Roles = new[] { 
        ApiRole.MeAdmin
        ApiRole.PasswordReset
        ApiRole.Shopper
    },
    ApiUrl: "https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io",
    AuthUrl: "https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io"
});
// Now that the sdk is configured it will automatically acquire, cache and refresh tokens implicitly as needed
`}}
/>

## A Unique Perspective
Authenticating as a buyer user provides a unique perspective. The `Shopper` role (reserved for buyer users) provides access to a miriad of personalized API resources that unravel and flatten complex relationships created by the admin user. These resources are commonly referred to as **Me and My Stuff**. 

<ContentLink subtitle="API Reference" type="bookmark" to="/api-reference/me-and-my-stuff">Me and My Stuff</ContentLink>

While other perspectives still can access the `/me` endpoint for managing their profile, they do not have access to its sub-resources. These resources are generally for interacting with data that the buyer user is assigned to at the organization, user group, or user level. A few of them are for managing data that the buyer user _owns_:

- **Personal Addresses** - a personal address book only accessible to the authenticated user
- **Personal Credit Cards** - essentially a wallet for storing credit card **tokens** retrieved from a 3rd party payment provider

> **Security Alert** - OrderCloud terms of service strictly prohibits storing full credit card information. Credit cards and payment processing should be handled by an authorized provider such as [Authorize.NET](https://authorize.net) or [Stripe](https://stripe.com).   

To access these features the buyer user must be granted specific roles: `MeAddressAdmin` and `MeCreditCardAdmin` respectively.

## Validate Your Perspective
Let's confirm we are in the correct perspective by getting the currently authenticated user using our new access token:

<CodeExample
  title="Get the currently authenticated user"
  content={{
    http: `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/me HTTP/1.1
Authentication: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8;`,
javascript: `import { Me } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Tokens.Set("INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE")\n
Me.Get()
  .then(response => {
      // returns the currently authenticated user object
      console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(err => console.log(err));`,
typescript: `import { Me, MeUser, OrderCloudError } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Me.Get()
  .then((response: MeUser) => {
      // returns the currently authenticated user object
      console.log(response);
  })
  .catch((err:OrderCloudError) => console.log(err));`,
csharp: `using OrderCloud.SDK;\n
// see previous example for configuring OrderCloudClient
var client = new OrderCloudClient(...);\n
var myself:MeUser = await client.Me.GetAsync();`}}
/>

Your response should look like this:

```json
{
	"Buyer": {
		"ID": "BUYER_ORGANIZATION",
		"DefaultCatalogID": "BUYER_ORGANIZATION"
	},
	"Supplier": null,
	"Seller": {
		"ID": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
	},
	"ID": "BUYER_USER",
	"Username": "buyer01",
	"Password": null,
	"FirstName": "Buyer",
	"LastName": "User",
	"Email": "buyer@email.com",
	"Phone": null,
	"TermsAccepted": null,
	"Active": true,
	"xp": null,
	"AvailableRoles": [
		"MeAdmin",
		"PasswordReset",
		"Shopper"
	],
	"DateCreated": "2021-02-08T23:09:14.82+00:00",
	"PasswordLastSetDate": "2021-02-08T23:10:00.56+00:00"
}
```

Pay close attention to `AvailableRoles`. If it does not match, take another look at when we [created our buyer user](/learn/getting-started/establishing-api-access#create-your-first-buyer-organization-and-user) in _"Establishing API Access"_ before continuing to the next guide.
