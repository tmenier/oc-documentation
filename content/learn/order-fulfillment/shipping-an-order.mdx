Let's assume we now have a different workflow that _does_ require shipments. OrderCloud provides a shorthand method so that you can automatically create a new shipment containing all of the line items on an order. It is called the **Order Ship** endpoint. Once everything is shipped, the order status is updated to "Complete" and the process is complete.

> If you already completed your order in the previous guide, you will need to create and submit another using the [buyer perspective](/learn/buyer-perspective/creating-your-first-order).

Let's go ahead and use the shorthand method of shipping and completing an order using the ID you retrieved in the previous guide:

<CodeExample
  title="Ship and complete an order"
  content={{
    http: `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/orders/incoming/INSERT_ORDER_ID_HERE/ship HTTP/1.1
Authentication: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8;`,
javascript: `import { Orders } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Orders.Ship("Incoming", "INSERT_ORDER_ID_HERE")
.then(response => {
    // returns the completed order
    console.log(response);
})
.catch(err => console.log(err));`,
typescript: `import { Orders, Order, OrderCloudError } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Orders.Ship("Incoming", "INSERT_ORDER_ID_HERE")
  .then((response: Order) => {
      // returns the completed order
      console.log(response);
  })
  .catch((err:OrderCloudError) => console.log(err));`,
csharp: `using OrderCloud.SDK;\n
var client = new OrderCloudClient(...);\n
try {
    Order response = await client.Orders.ShipAsync("Incoming", "INSERT_ORDER_ID_HERE")
} catch(OrderCloudException ex) {
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}`
}}
/>

## Viewing Shipments
Now that you have shipped and completed your order, you should be able to view the order's shipments using the OrderCloud **Shipments** resource.

<ContentLink to="/api-reference/orders-and-fulfillment/shipments" subtitle="API Reference" type="bookmark">OrderCloud Shipments</ContentLink>

<CodeExample
  title="View order shipments"
  content={{
    http: `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/shipments?orderID="INSERT_ORDER_ID_HERE" HTTP/1.1
Authentication: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8;`,
javascript: `import { Shipments } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Shipments.List({OrderID: "INSERT_ORDER_ID_HERE"})
.then(response => {
    // returns the completed order
    console.log(response);
})
.catch(err => console.log(err));`,
typescript: `import { Shipments, Shipment, ListPage, OrderCloudError } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Shipments.List({OrderID: "INSERT_ORDER_ID_HERE"})
  .then((response: ListPage<Shipment>) => {
      // returns the completed order
      console.log(response);
  })
  .catch((err:OrderCloudError) => console.log(err));`,
csharp: `using OrderCloud.SDK;\n
var client = new OrderCloudClient(...);\n
try {
    ListPage<Shipment> response = await client.Shipments.ListAsync({ 
        OrderID = "INSERT_ORDER_ID_HERE" 
    })
} catch(OrderCloudException ex) {
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}`
}}
/>
