In this chapter we've investigated your default buyer catalog and created a new product with a default price schedule. Our default catalog has `ViewAllProducts` set to `true`, so one might think that your product is ready for buyer users to purchase! This is a common misconception, as products are not inherently part of a catalog. They exist apart, so that sellers can share products across many catalogs.

## Connecting the dots
To make the product visible in our example we must assign it directly to the default buyer catalog. This is called a product-catalog assignment. 

In other scenarios this assignment is created automatically when you assign products to a category within a catalog, similar to when you update a buyer organization's `DefaultCatalogID` and OrderCloud creates the buyer-catalog assignment for you.

For this reason many developers overlook the fact that they need to explicitly assign a product to a catalog in the absence of categories.

<CodeExample
  title="Assign the product to the default catalog"
  content={{
    http: `PUT https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/catalogs/productassignments HTTP/1.1
Authentication: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8;\n
{
    CatalogID: "BUYER_ORGANIZATION",
    ProductID: "SHIRT"
}`,
javascript: `import { Catalogs } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Catalogs.SaveProductAssignment({
  CatalogID: "BUYER_ORGANIZATION",
  ProductID: "SHIRT",
})
  .then((response) => {
    // responds with 204 no content (empty response) when successful
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));`,
typescript: `import { Catalogs, ProductCatalogAssignment, OrderCloudError } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
var assignment: ProductCatalogAssignment = {
  CatalogID: "BUYER_ORGANIZATION",
  ProductID: "SHIRT"
}
Catalogs.SaveProductAssignment(assignment)
  .then((response: void) => {
    // responds with 204 no content (empty response) when successful
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch((err: OrderCloudError) => console.log(err));`,
csharp: `using OrderCloud.SDK;\n
var client = new OrderCloudClient(...);\n
var assignment = new ProductCatalogAssignment {
    CatalogID = "BUYER_ORGANIZATION",
    ProductID = "SHIRT"
};\n
try {
    await _oc.Catalogs.SaveProductAssignmentAsync(assignment);
} catch(OrderCloudException ex) {
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}`}}
/>

You now have a working product catalog! It may be simple, but it has everything you need to start creating orders in the buyer perspective.
